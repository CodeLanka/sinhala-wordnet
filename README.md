# Sinhala wordnet
Sinhala WordNet is a large lexical database of Sinhala( Sinhalese ). 

Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. 
Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. 
The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. 
'Sinhala WordNet' is also freely and publicly available for download. 
WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.
